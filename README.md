**WebFW** is a small, simple PHP5-based MVC framework that tries to
adopt common patterns and get you up and running with an app in minutes.
It's written for learning purposes and for when I feel like reinventing
wheels.

Feel free to use it, although take note of the elephant-sized
holes where things like validation, filtering are missing. Check the
TODO file if you're interested in plugging some :)

There is a [sample application][WebFWSample] that's worth checking out
to show how easy it is to start.
